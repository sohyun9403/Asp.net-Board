# Asp.net-Board

1. MS-SQL (SQL Management Studio)

First of all, User have to download the Studio.
By turns, Open 4 sql files and execute(F5).

2. Visual Studio 2010

Start with [Open Websites] - Those files.
Set up web.config as your datasource, id, pwd.
And now Users build with signup.aspx or login.aspx.

I think IIS is no necessary, but Users need, have to download and add a virtual repository.
